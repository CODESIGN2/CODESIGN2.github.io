		<h3>Proud to promote excellence</h3>
		<p>We are a small Essex-based business; far from let this hold us back, we put processes and procedures in-place to ensure we don't need the huge infrastructure, and some of the overheads that come with being a national, trans-national, or international business.</p>
		<p>Something we are really good at is providing expert advice, and services that meet standards defined outside of our business, such as file-formats, coding-conventions, and making good use of the tools and technologies available to help you push yourself to the next level.</p>

		<h3>Powered by automation &amp; integration</h3>
		<p>We are also experts in automation, and systems integration, and have our own WordPress, CORE, CRM &amp; ERP solutions; which we can deploy, bespoke, migrate your existing and legacy systems to, and integrate with your other service providers, systems, processes and information. This can help to ensure you remain compliant, save-time, and gain critical insight into the data driving your business.</p>
		<p>Currently systems we have integrated with include AppFog, Twilio, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Shopify, WordPress, Evernote, Docslot, AIMS 360 ERP, EasyShop, Google Apps, DigitalOcean, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Office, Open / Libreoffice, QuickBooks, Dreamhost, Rackspace, DropBox, Paypal, Stripe, Azure, SharePoint, Firebase &amp; Trello, as well as many bespoke and legacy systems.</p>
		
		<h3>Keeping it lean</h3>
		<p>Because we are more lean and agile than most businesses, and because we like people, we can put people first, and strive for our designs, innovations and advice to be people-centric. We don't jump on band-wagons, we do favor a lean approach with addons for the additional. Because we are not targetted at multi-national businesses only, we work with businesses from your local businesses, to trans-national e-commerce sites, and have even worked on public sector, and government projects.</p>
