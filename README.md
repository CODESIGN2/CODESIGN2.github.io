# CODESIGN2.github.io

These are the Jekyll source files for the 2015 June modifications of the CODESIGN2 website. ***congratulations, you can use git / github if you can find this***

The main differences between this and many Jekyll projects you will see is the use of _content collection for repeatable content blocks. The syntax for the includes for this repo has been adjusted for Jekyll 3.0.0.pre.beta7, and may be subjet to revision in newer Jekyll versions. The reason this is not being used to generate on gh-pages is we have plugins we cannot use on github-pages, but; the plugins work fine when generated on local machines, and then the source and output can be updated separately.
