			Unfortunately, we were not able to read the budget you entered. We need this information to filter out valid enquiries. If you beleive you are seeing this in error, please feel free to drop us a line on support@codesign2.co.uk; otherwise please try again, including a valid ball-park figure, or range with the relevant currency. This does not have to be an exact amount, but essentially, if the budget cannot cover the works required, it wastes both our time and skills.

			Thanks so much for your understanding. <a href="javascript:window.history.back();">Please go back</a>, give us a chance to help, or have a fantastic day!
